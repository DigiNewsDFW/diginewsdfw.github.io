  <h2>MetroPCS rebrands, links up with Google and Amazon</h2>
  <small>By Danielle Abril</small>

<p>
  MetroPCS is aiming to change the public perception of its prepaid phone service. So the company is rebranding, changing its name and logo, as well as offering
  some new plans that include Google and Amazon services.
</p>

<p>
  When I met MetroPCS president Tom Keys about two years ago during my time at the <i>Dallas Business Journal</i>, one of the things he stressed was never taking his place
  of leadership for granted. Keys has been at the top of the 24-year-old brand since 2007. And he leads from a place of humility, he reiterated to me last week.
</p>

<p>
  So when he helped lead a research effort into understanding what his company could do better, he again remained humble. “We haven't done a good enough job with
  our messaging, and I'm the first one to say that's on me,” Keys told <i>The Dallas Morning News</i>.
</p>

<p>
  The findings of the research was “eye-opening,” said Keys, who learned why people didn't sign up with MetroPCS. But it helped him and the company strategize growth moving forward. 
</p>

<p>
  With its new offerings, partnerships and branding, Metro by T-Mobile, as its now called, expects to increase its top line within 36 to 60 months.
</p>
